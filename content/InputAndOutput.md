System.out is a Printstream, initialized to the standard output (usually the screen or terminal program). We normally use its following methods:
+ print - takes one string, prints it to the screen
+ println - takes one string, prints it to the screen and starts a new line 
+ printf - works like C's printf (useful if you know printf, don't worry if you don't :)
